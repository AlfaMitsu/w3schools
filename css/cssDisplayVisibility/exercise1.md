Hide the <h1> element. It should still take up the same space as before.

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
      <style>
        h1 {
          visibility: hidden;
        }
      </style>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>This is a heading</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph</p>
      <p>This is a paragraph</p>
    </body>
    </html>
