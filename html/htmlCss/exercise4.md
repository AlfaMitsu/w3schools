Use CSS to make a yellow, 1 pixel thick, border around all paragraphs.

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <style>
    p {
      border: 1px solid yellow;
    }
    </style>
    </head>
    <body>
    
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    
    </body>
    </html>
